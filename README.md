# Creating-Reusable-Function.308.5.1
# This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental programming principles, particularly "Don't Repeat Yourself(DRY)," through the creation of a reusable JavaScript function

#Project Structure
Part 1: Thinking Functionally - Focuses on creating standalone functions for basic data manipulation tasks
Part 2: Thinking Methodically - Utilizes built-in JavaScript array methods to perform more complex data handling
Part 3: Thinking Critically - Demonstrates object manipulation and considerations when working with references and values in JavaScript

Features
The functions created in this project include:
1. Sum and Average Calculation
    Calculate the sum of an array of numbers.
    Determine the average of numbers in an array.
2. String Manipulation
    Find the longest string in an array.
    Filter strings by length.
3. Recursive Functions
    Print numbers from 1 to n using recursion.
4. Advanced Array Handling
    Sort an array of objects by a numeric property.
    Filter an array based on conditional logic.
    Modify and update elements within an array of objects.
5. Object Property Manipulation
    Increment the age property of an object.
